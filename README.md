Electronic Observer is a browser to help admirals manage their fleets. It is packed with features to provide additional informations for admirals to plan and play KanColle better.

## Main Features
Each function is located in separate windows, and can be freely docked, moved, and arranged by the user.  
Below is a brief explanation. **For more details, please see the [Wiki.](https://github.com/RyuuKitsune/ElectronicObserver/wiki)**  

* Internal browser (including screenshot, mute, and zoom)
* Fleet display (status [on expedition, needs supplies, etc.], air power, LoS)
    * Individual ship display (Level, HP, condition, supplies, equipment slots)
    * Fleet list (see all fleet statuses at a glance)
    * Grouping (group your ships and track them differently)
* Dock (current ships, remaining time)
* Arsenal (current construction, remaining time)
* Headquarters (Admiral status, resource display)
* Compass (upcoming route, enemy fleet display, resource gain/losses)
* Battle (battle prediction and results)
* Information (unseen CGs, crafting results, map gauges)
* Quests (with complete tracking)
* Encyclopedia (of ships and equipment)
* Equipment List
* Notifications (expeditions, docing, critical damage, and more)
* Records (keep records of drops, constructions, and developments)
* Window Capture (capture external windows into the program)

None of these functions interfere with KanColle normal, legal operation.
